### Description and Question :-

I have used browser debugger tool identify the main problem which is component not rendering. I found three issues :

### Answer :-

1. To render the component when user send a message, create new variable (copy of old) and make changes in that variable before setting the state value.
2. Use async await on "postMessage" function because "saveMessage" returns a promis.
3. To display correct order of message sort the messages by ids.

### Description and Question :-

We want to track for each message if it has been read by the recipient, and to make several front end UI updates with this information, such as displaying how many unread messages there are in a given conversation.

You can reference the spec in this Figma file for the various updates to be made to reflect unread messages. (Note that the Figma file includes more than just the spec needed for this feature). Please include a screenshot in your description showing your updated UI.

In your description, please explain a couple different ways we could have stored the read status in the database for this feature. What are the benefits and drawbacks of each?

### Answer :-

##### Updated Login UI

##### Updated Register UI

##### Display Unread Message

##### Added Emoji and File Upload on Input field

##### Show Typing Indicator

I can think of one way to read status - For every message, we can store a key read time. When user read those messages, we can update it accordingly. Benefit for this approach is that we can track the read time of the message by storing it. The drawbacks of this approach need to add more extra fields on database and update it.

### Description and Question :-

Weâ€™ve received new specs from our designer. Please implement the design for the login and signup pages, and make it mobile responsive. The design spec and needed assets are available in this zip folder, as well as in this Figma file. The spec may need a bit of adapting to fit our use case, so please use your best judgement. Also note that the resources provided include more than just the login and signup pages, but only these two pages should be implemented for this ticket.

Please include a couple of screenshots in the description when making this description to showcase the styling you've done.

In your description, please explain a couple different ways we could have handled code organization for this feature. Are there the benefits and drawbacks for each?

### Answer :-

Since, This repository is using Material UI, making responsive site is quite easy. We can use bootstrap or other css farmwork to implement
responsive desgin which makes building a site fast and easy. We can also make it responsive without using material ui, bootstrap or any other css framework which makes build a site quite hard and slow because then we have to write css for every small devices.
